      "options": ["Content must be entertaining", "Content must be visible to admins", "Content must be perceivable by all users", "Content must be free"],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Perceivable means that users must be able to detect and understand content using at least one of their senses (e.g., sight, hearing). If something can’t be seen, heard, or otherwise sensed, it isn’t accessible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which action helps make content perceivable?",
      "options": ["Use low contrast colors", "Replace text with images", "Provide alternative text for images", "Use Flash animations"],
